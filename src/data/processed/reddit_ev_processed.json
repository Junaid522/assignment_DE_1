And there\u2019s lots of fun interior specs like a smart sunroof, 360 backup camera, and a large carplay screen. \n\nWhen they first announced the Buzz in 2016\/2017 I was immediately hooked! I was like yes that\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. So I went to the VW dealership where I had bought 3 cars prior, and begged for information. They or course had nothing to share. Since then I have been annoying my sales rep (sorry man!) and reading every article and update I could find about it. \n\nI found myself in need of a new car in 2022 and got an ID.4. It has been really fun diving into the EV world. I love the way the ID.4 drives and glides down the road. And all the tech gadgets are fun also! \n\nYesterday. Finally. I got the call from VW that there was a Buzz on the lot that I could come look at. I went down this morning and fell in love! \n\nThe ID. Buzz gives me all the warm nostalgic feelings but with new fancy features! It drives very smooth, just like the ID4. The battery has a huge capacity, there\u2019s a ton of modular space on the inside, and it\u2019s also very zippy! \n\nMy only complaint is the high step up to get inside. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get used to that. \n\nI\u2019m so stoked to finally have this amazing vehicle! Can\u2019t wait to plan a trip and really test it out! \n",

Many of us are willing to listen. \n\nWith that, last month my views on electric vehicles changed. A lot. \n\nI was at CarMax and as the agent was showing me options, I noticed a car in my price range that claimed to have CarPlay. \n\nI noticed it was an EV (2019 Nissan Leaf) and because there were only a few options for my budget with CarPlay I decided to test drive it. \n\nI instantly fell in love with everything about it. \n\nThe car is as quiet inside as many higher end Mercedes Benz models (measured by Car and Driver magazine)\n\nIt is relatively speedy off a stop, it turns well. \n\nAnd to top it all off, it costs 1\/4 the cost to run. Probably less because the regenerative braking means I likely won\u2019t ever need a brake job over the time I own it. \n\nThe negative is that there was no CarPlay. They mislabeled the car in their inventory and I ended up negotiating a $200 price reduction and getting an external dash system for that. \n\nYet even after driving gasoline cars with CarPlay, I stuck with this little leaf. \n\nOnce I sat in it and drove it, felt no vibration from an engine, no shifting through the transmission, and how cold the AC gets so quickly (I\u2019m in Vegas, this matters) I was hooked. \n\nNext up is something much better with larger range. This only has 150 mile range. Better credit, trade in, new EV? \n\nLikely yea. \n\nThere are things I don\u2019t like. \n\nI am nearly over range anxiety. I haven\u2019t driven it in the winter with the heat on and that bothers me to think of what the battery may do. \n\nBecause I\u2019m in Nevada and we don\u2019t have many intra state highways to begin with, long trips are nearly impossible, and since many of them are over steep grades, and the charging stations sometimes don\u2019t work, I won\u2019t even try them. \n\nSo my tune has changed. I\u2019ll tell anyone to look in this direction. \n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this if you\u2019re trying to sell people like me on the idea:\n\nIt isn\u2019t so much about the environment to people like me. \n\nI believe in global warming. I also watch billionaires scream about it and take private jets. \n\nYou\u2019ll not win that position with many conservatives but we all feel the crunch of the economy, and this helps a great deal. \n\nWe all like nice stuff. If I knew how practically silent this thing was inside and how fun it was to drive, I would have actively looked at an EV as an option. \n\nIs this the future? Yes. \n\nDoes it need a better message for folks like me? \ud83d\udcaf yes. \n\nThanks all for reading.",

I was always put off by the usual issues (price, range, lack of infrastructure) and was convinced that it would be a long time before I owned an EV.\n\nMy favorite cars have been German hot hatches and performance sedans. I'm a \"save the manuals\" guy and love the sound of a V8. Some of my dream cars include classic cars, Lamborghinis, and Hellcats.\n\nRecently I came across a very inexpensive used Leaf while browsing things for sale. (cheap even by gen 1 Leaf standards) I immediately contacted the seller and bought it.\n\nEven with only \"90\" miles of range (according to the guess o meter), it's more than adequate for my daily needs around town and I can easily keep it charged on the level 1 charger that came with it.\n\nI love the way the electric powertrain feels. Even though the gen 1 leaf has a comparatively weak motor, it's plenty of zip in my daily city driving. (I almost never get on highways and the fastest roads are 45mph) As a gearhead, I underestimated how much I would enjoy the silence, smoothness, response, and torque of the electric powertrain. I also underestimated how much I enjoyed the efficiency of not sitting idling in traffic.\n\nWhen I bought it, I had no plans to sell my previous commuter car but in less than a week I changed my mind. I plan on keeping my old pickup truck because I haul things for my business and can also use it when I need to drive long distances. Because of this, the Leaf's range is more than adequate for me and my daily EV driving more than makes up for my use of a truck on my occasional long-distance trip.\n\nI'm sharing this hoping that other people reading this may also have their opinion swayed on electric cars. People who, like me, enjoy gasoline-powered cars and are unsure about EVs. I've already got my V8 truck-driving friend intrigued. I crunched the numbers for him and the difference in fuel cost between his truck and my leaf would pay for my leaf in less than a year.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the comments. I've made an effort to read every one so far. Here's some more info if you want some ammo to convince others. I know this info is out there but again it's one more bit of evidence to add to the pile. Plus I was curious and had already done the math.\n\nIn the two weeks I've owned my Leaf, I'm averaging 4.3 miles per kwh. Even at $0.15 per kwh, my Leaf costs about 3.5 cents per mile in electricity.\n\nMy 4 cylinder hatchback got an average of 24mpg which @$3.00\/gallon is 12.5 cents per mile.\n\nMy friend's V8 truck averages 15mpg which equates to 20 cents per mile.\n\nOver 100,000 miles, my Leaf costs $3,500 in electricity while my hatchback costs $12,500 and the truck costs $20,000.",

Buckle up, data nerds, because I\u2019ve tracked **EVERYTHING**.\n\n[Delivery Day \\(2018\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9hjv6t9su2ta1.jpg?width=1747&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=facb022de6851dd962727be02f0b7e484be0d08c)\n\n# Five Years of Model 3 Ownership by the Numbers\n\n**58,168** \\- Odometer reading - This works out 11,633 miles per year, under the average 13,500 miles per year driven by US drivers. I have a short commute.\n\n**14,115\u2019** \\- Highest Elevation Driven - Pike\u2019s Peak, Colorado. The battery charged from 42% to 52% on the way back down.\n\n**7385** \\- Sequence number of the car, aka the 7385th Model 3 built by Tesla. Approximately 1.9 million have been manufactured since making this car older than 99.6% of Model 3\u2019s you see on the road.\n\n**2,805 mi** \\- Longest Road Trip - Ohio to Colorado Springs and back in the summer of 2020.\n\n[Lifetime Drive Map](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9j53zpxxu2ta1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85b154aa9d138f05ee80131bd568622e6c10dd8e)\n\n**261** \\- Watt-hours per mile consumed - this is the average efficiency of the car throughout its lifetime.  A single gallon of gasoline contains 33,700 watt-hours of energy. This means 261 Wh\/mi is the same as 129 mpg (33,700\/261).  Thanks for the correction, commenters. I somehow messed up the math in the original post.\n\n**94%** \\- Percentage of charges that took place at home.\n\n**74** \\- Software updates (since I started counting in Jan 2019 - so there were more). Software updates download via the internet, just as they do to your cell phone. Some features added over the years that the car didn\u2019t come with include: The ability to change lanes automatically on the highway and autonomously take highway exits, the ability to drive autonomously in a parking lot and pick me up at the door, Spotify, Netflix, video games, and a fart machine.\n\n**30 min** \\- Average length of each charging stop on road trips. The majority of these charges were while we ate lunch or dinner. In fact, all the meal stops likely brought up the average since we would often stay longer than necessary eating. The necessary amount of time to stop is usually closer to 20 minutes.\n\n**$27** \\- Average additional cost of electricity to our monthly power bill incurred by the car.\n\n**13.5** \\- Megawatt Hours Consumed - Total energy consumed by the car. This is enough electricity to power the average home in Ohio for 1.25 years.\n\n**5** \\- Service Center Visits - Total cost $885 (a windshield - everything else warranty\/recall).\n\n**3** \\- Mobile Service Visits to my home - Total cost $216 (to repair a torn underbody shield).\n\n**3** \\- Windshields replaced - rear window spontaneously cracked (replaced under warranty in 2018), front windshield cracked out during a failed Safelite rock chip fix in 2019, [front windshield destroyed by a snowplow in 2022](https:\/\/youtu.be\/WzQqbbxbuLw) (fixed for free courtesy of ODOT).\n\n[RIP Windshield #2](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ha3k04qnx2ta1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=2708a6b54661c3aabadc99570cd1310cf7838814)\n\n**3** \\- Sets of tires. I admittedly blew through my stock set of all seasons by 20k miles. I've been much more kind to my tires since. I'm currently swapping between a summer set and a winter set, and both have 1-2 seasons of life on them.\n\n**3** \\- Test drives given to complete strangers - In the early days, Tesla was not making inventory vehicles. Every Model 3 was delivered to a customer, so you couldn\u2019t drive one unless you bought one. Three people found me in various ways and test-drove my car before they purchased one for themselves.\n\n**1** \\- Number of times we couldn\u2019t go someplace because we were in an electric car. Wanted to visit Great Sand Dunes National Park while staying in Colorado Springs. The car had to charge on the way back, but the charger was so out of the way that it would have added hours of drive time. We did something closer instead.\n\n**0.3%** \\- Lowest useable battery capacity reached - First Thanksgiving with the car. I had calculated we could make all the family visits we needed to get to that day on one charge but didn\u2019t realize the car loses 3% of its battery capacity every time it\u2019s parked in sub-zero temperatures. Still unsure why. It must have something to do with keeping the battery warm.\n\n**0** \\- Number of times the battery died before reaching a charger. The example above was the only close call.\n\n**0** \\- Number of brake services and oil changes\n\n**0** \\- Number of times Autopilot crashed the car",
