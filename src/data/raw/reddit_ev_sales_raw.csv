1jc7cr3,From two Tesla's to none.,19218,1507,1742079141.0,"Had two Model Y's but didn't want to keep them and they were depreciating before our eyes as we checked the prices so bit the bullet and swapped out both. Had varying amounts of equity in the cars but got what we could that would match our realistic needs. Bittersweet but one less thing we needed to think about! 

Aside - Used bolts are crazy cheap! Kinda plasticy but for the 2 mile commute it works.

Ioniq 6 is super long! Bolt is not pulled in all the way else it would really show. Was able to get a 2023 with only 1700 miles which is crazy, but while the rated range is 270 vs 310 on the Y, in the 80 mile drive to the dealer and then back the Ioniq used less of the battery percentage. Some variability in the drives but at least a very close match.

Insurance also went down with each purchase which was nice.",https://i.redd.it/va0mux3pnxoe1.jpeg
1jfwaaf,"Farewell Tesla, Hello Lucid 👋",4923,1012,1742496468.0,"My first EV—a marvel of engineering. When I bought it in late 2023, I acknowledged Elon’s presence but justified the purchase, knowing the world isn’t just black and white.

But over the past few months, something shifted. Call it a growing discomfort, or for lack of a better word, the ick.

The final straw? The Rose Garden shoot. A week later, as I sat at a red light, it hit me—I simply couldn’t drive this car anymore, no matter how impressive it was.

And so, today, I say goodbye. I won’t be buying a Tesla again. For those curious, Carvana was about 2K more than Lucid trade in offer and Carmax/KBB. Still sold at a loss, yes, I realize my privilege saying that. Lucid is now offering a 2K Tesla Trade-In bonus on select states that makes it more compelling even if the Carvana price is better but I just went for the simplicity of trading in with them.

If anyone is curious what the situation of Tesla is like, just go to Carvana and look at the sheer number of cars with under 10K mileage for sale. Astounding. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jfwaaf
1ie1jty,Finally did it. Out with the Tesla.,3868,852,1738281707.0,"
Hey Everyone,

I have been a Tesla model y driver the last three years. My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. 

Last night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. 

I feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1ie1jty/finally_did_it_out_with_the_tesla/
1i3tju5,Been waiting 8 years for this beauty and she’s finally mine! ,3624,246,1737155534.0,"Check out my brand new 2025 Volkswagen ID. Buzz with a blue two-tone exterior. It’s a first edition AWD with a 91kWh battery and 330 horsepower. And there’s lots of fun interior specs like a smart sunroof, 360 backup camera, and a large carplay screen. 

When they first announced the Buzz in 2016/2017 I was immediately hooked! I was like yes that’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen. So I went to the VW dealership where I had bought 3 cars prior, and begged for information. They or course had nothing to share. Since then I have been annoying my sales rep (sorry man!) and reading every article and update I could find about it. 

I found myself in need of a new car in 2022 and got an ID.4. It has been really fun diving into the EV world. I love the way the ID.4 drives and glides down the road. And all the tech gadgets are fun also! 

Yesterday. Finally. I got the call from VW that there was a Buzz on the lot that I could come look at. I went down this morning and fell in love! 

The ID. Buzz gives me all the warm nostalgic feelings but with new fancy features! It drives very smooth, just like the ID4. The battery has a huge capacity, there’s a ton of modular space on the inside, and it’s also very zippy! 

My only complaint is the high step up to get inside. But I’m sure I’ll get used to that. 

I’m so stoked to finally have this amazing vehicle! Can’t wait to plan a trip and really test it out!

1jxbik3,Tesla Canada says its shady $43 million incentive grab was a misunderstanding,1234,387,1744441512.0,"

Tesla has sent a response to Transport Canada about its sudden incentive cash grab from March, stating that this is standard process and suggesting that the incentives were for backdated sales that Tesla hadn’t filed yet.

Until recently, Canada had a $5,000 incentive for electric vehicle purchases, similar to the US $7,500 federal incentive from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

That ended earlier this year, though as the incentive program ran out of money more quickly than expected, and it didn’t look like the government was going to refill the program anytime soon. Canada is also currently going through a contentious federal election process, so it was unlikely for its government to move on refilling this incentive while things are shaken up.

So, the government communicated in January that the program would run out of money soon – very soon – giving dealers only a few days to claim incentives.

Then in March, it was reported by the Toronto Star that something suspicious had happened with Tesla, as it had filed for 8,653 EV sales within the last 72 hours of the Canadian rebate incentive, an abnormally high number.

One Tesla locations in particular, Quebec City, claimed 4,000 rebates over the course of a weekend, which is physically impossible for a location of that size, and represents about a ~20x spike in daily deliveries for the location. Another location in Etobicoke reportedly claimed 2,528 rebates over the weekend, which is more than all the rebates that location had previously claimed combined.

The alarm was raised by the Canadian Auto Dealers Association, which said its dealers as a whole had been left out of around $10 million in rebates representing 2,295 cars. Dealerships claimed that “Tesla gamed the system” and that “they cleared everyone else out.”

13r4skr,Bought a (very) cheap EV two weeks ago and it's completely changed my mind on EVs.,1166,427,1684979999.0,"As a car enthusiast, I have been watching EVs since I first heard about Tesla (back when they were still developing the original roadster). I was always put off by the usual issues (price, range, lack of infrastructure) and was convinced that it would be a long time before I owned an EV.

My favorite cars have been German hot hatches and performance sedans. I'm a ""save the manuals"" guy and love the sound of a V8. Some of my dream cars include classic cars, Lamborghinis, and Hellcats.

Recently I came across a very inexpensive used Leaf while browsing things for sale. (cheap even by gen 1 Leaf standards) I immediately contacted the seller and bought it.

Even with only ""90"" miles of range (according to the guess o meter), it's more than adequate for my daily needs around town and I can easily keep it charged on the level 1 charger that came with it.

I love the way the electric powertrain feels. Even though the gen 1 leaf has a comparatively weak motor, it's plenty of zip in my daily city driving. (I almost never get on highways and the fastest roads are 45mph) As a gearhead, I underestimated how much I would enjoy the silence, smoothness, response, and torque of the electric powertrain. I also underestimated how much I enjoyed the efficiency of not sitting idling in traffic.

When I bought it, I had no plans to sell my previous commuter car but in less than a week I changed my mind. I plan on keeping my old pickup truck because I haul things for my business and can also use it when I need to drive long distances. Because of this, the Leaf's range is more than adequate for me and my daily EV driving more than makes up for my use of a truck on my occasional long-distance trip.

I'm sharing this hoping that other people reading this may also have their opinion swayed on electric cars. People who, like me, enjoy gasoline-powered cars and are unsure about EVs. I've already got my V8 truck-driving friend intrigued. I crunched the numbers for him and the difference in fuel cost between his truck and my leaf would pay for my leaf in less than a year.

Edit: Thanks for all of the comments. I've made an effort to read every one so far. Here's some more info if you want some ammo to convince others. I know this info is out there but again it's one more bit of evidence to add to the pile. Plus I was curious and had already done the math.

In the two weeks I've owned my Leaf, I'm averaging 4.3 miles per kwh. Even at $0.15 per kwh, my Leaf costs about 3.5 cents per mile in electricity.

My 4 cylinder hatchback got an average of 24mpg which @$3.00/gallon is 12.5 cents per mile.

My friend's V8 truck averages 15mpg which equates to 20 cents per mile.

Over 100,000 miles, my Leaf costs $3,500 in electricity while my hatchback costs $12,500 and the truck costs $20,000.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/13r4skr/bought_a_very_cheap_ev_two_weeks_ago_and_its/

The software is fully updated. It has now had a high voltage system failure three separate times. My dealer told me that I’m not the first customer of theirs that this has happened to.

My Blazer EV was in service for 29 out of my first 45 days of ownership, and will now be back in service again for the same issue.

https://imgur.com/a/JQR7j9D

Notice the difference in mileage between all of these pictures. I took each of these pictures immediately after the error codes popped up.

To make matters worse, I was on a 300 mile road trip for work when the error code popped up yesterday. I was charging at a fast charger and the charging stopped. I luckily had enough charge to make it home at 2% battery. I had to drive home in 100° heat for an hour and a half with no AC to conserve range because the Blazer EV quit charging unexpectedly.

My Blazer EV is sitting in my garage unable to charge, stuck at 2%. The dealership is getting it towed to them Monday morning and bringing me a loaner.

I asked GM to buy back the car after the second high voltage system issue. I said it was not reliable or safe. GM refused my buy back request before because the car was “fixed”.

Less than a month later I was over 100 miles from home, charging quit unexpectedly, in 100° heat, and worried if I’d make it home safely.

All because of the Chevrolet Blazer EV.

**The Chevrolet Blazer EV is a safety hazard.** Avoid the Blazer EV at all costs. GM is a nightmare. They don’t stand behind their products because their products are terrible.

Additionally, the front driver side contains the AC cooling pipes. Those got damaged in addition to the mounting apparatus for the AC is damaged as well, this means that a significant portion of the AC system will need to be replaced. Luckily, I have insurance and I am not at fault and won't see premiums increase.

Note regarding insurance, I have comprehensive coverage meaning that in situations where it was a deer hit, theft, hail, etc. premiums do not increase. This however does NOT mean there is no impact. Progressive can choose to drop me as a client since they have now taken a massive loss on me. If I choose to bring in more EVs like this, it will likely occur and they will either charge me a higher price premium or drop me as a customer.

Something else to note that was said in the comments is that the meaning of ""totaled' does not mean unrepairable, it means that it is uneconomical to repair. I got this vehicle as a lease for 72k, down from MSRP of 92k. The current value of this vehicle w/ \~10k miles in excellent condition is deemed to be 60k. This means that repairs that cost >40k (70%) will automatically make the vehicle ""totaled"" even if the vehicle is totally fine and drivable. 

Also, the situation is NOT better w/ EV startups. Ppl claiming this is an issue w/ traditional automakers are missing the point. This is a FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE across all automakers that is plaguing EVs. These vehicles are NOT easily repairable, parts are impossible to fund, and labor ridiculously expensive.

Tesla’s [China sales figure in April of 28,731 vehicles](https://cnevpost.com/2025/05/11/tesla-retail-sales-china-28731-apr-2025/) is especially disappointing - or catastrophic, as Tesla now has a grand total of zero growth markets - since Tesla had already fully ramped up production of its refreshed Model Y by the start of April, as evidenced by the company’s recent boast that it [took just six weeks to ramp up fully](https://cnevpost.com/2025/05/09/tesla-shanghai-capacity-ramp-up-model-y-6-weeks/) after commencing factory production of the revamped model on February 18th.

China Is Done With Global Automakers: ""Thanks For Coming"" 

The visiting team is still on the field, running around as fast as it can, trying to forge a comeback. For decades, they thought they were playing on a familiar field. But time is up, the game is over. 

China - the home team – is the winner. Spectators have just watched a sudden and catastrophic collapse of global automakers in China. How did it happen? • • • For most of this century, foreign brands totally dominated China’s car market. 

Every year, they sold millions of cars and earned billions in profits. Chinese consumers swarmed into Buick, Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota showrooms nationwide, happy to pay cash for the prestige of owning a brand that wasn’t Chinese. 

“China is our forever profit machine,” my colleagues at GM liked to humble-brag a decade ago, back when I ran GM’s Indonesia operations. “We can bank on an easy $2 billion dividend every year.” Now, suddenly, that golden era is over. Sales and profits in the People’s Republic are vanishing. And boards in Detroit, Wolfsburg and Tokyo are stunned by the speed and intensity of the changes. 

Panic in Detroit - And Everywhere Else - Ford has lost more than $5 billion in China since 2020. Sales are down 70% from their peak. “We’ve never seen competition like this before,” says CEO Jim Farley. 

GM is hurting, too. The former poster child for sunny US-China relations, GM has lost more than $200 million so far this year alone. That marks the first time in two decades that GM’s China operations have printed red ink. Mary Barra says the situation in China is “unsustainable.” Stellantis already knows the bitter taste of capitulation. Jeep was forced to beat an ignominious retreat from the China market in 2023 after its joint venture went bankrupt. 

Detroit is not alone. Almost every non-Chinese brand – German, Korean, Japanese and French – is feeling shell-shocked as they watch their market shares disappear.Electric Take-Off Driving China’s ascendancy is a massive and abrupt shift to electric vehicles. 

The EV share of total car sales will jump to almost 50% this year, up from just 6% in 2020. Think about that. China has sprinted from 1 million to more than 10 million annual EV deliveries in just four short years. (I already see you dealership folks scratching your heads in amazement.)Global automakers were caught flat-footed on EVs, lulled into complacency by years of winning at selling gasoline-powered vehicles. 

Chinese automakers, in contrast, seized on the shift to electrics. This year, eighteen of the twenty best-selling EVs are Chinese brands. The other two are Teslas. Advanced Technology is no secret that global automakers are finding it impossible to match Chinese competitors on costs.Reached the word count limit.

Tesla market share in the United States is about half the EV’s sold now, and has been declining as other automakers produce decent cars with good range, which also do the other ‘car things’ well.

But that was happening way before everyone’s opinions changed about Musk, and seems to be mostly in line with what one would expect with greater competition the market.

The people with the bumper stickers, I imagine are also people who are fairly politically motivated, who were early adaptors of EV’s, etc. I’m not sure we can read too much into that, because it’s tiny minority, and as EV’s become more mainstream, that will not be the median buyer.

There will be buyers who are alienated, and those who are attracted, by his political activity.

Maybe more of a rant than a review but we went and test drove an Ioniq 5 today and it was our first experience with an EV.

Get to the dealership and the salesman immediately admits he's never sold nor rode in an EV. I asked if I could speak to their sales manager again and this time he admitted that their resident expert had quit earlier in the month and no one there had much experience.

1) Salesman rode along and talked the entire time about the Palisade
2) We were limited to 3 miles of driving each. When asked why, we were told by the salesman that the dealership liked to trade them away to the dealer an hour away.
3) We had to google how to put the car in reverse and drive.
4) My wife asked me ""is this the car that's supposed to charge in 18 minutes"" and the salesman interpreted and said ""no, no - this car is equiped with a Level 1 charger so it's really slow compared to a gas car""
5) At the conclusion of our test drive, the salesman asked if we wanted to test drive the Palisade since it's their highest selling car and he's sold 15 of them this month",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/16wn1md/wife_blacklisted_ioniq_5_after_terrible_sales/

1fide15,Our experience owning an EV and losing power for 7 days,607,271,1726514567.0,"Our family endured 7 days without electricity due to the 2024 summer storm in Northern Ohio.

Lots of people ask EV owners ""What will you do when the power is out?"" and I want to share our experience.

I don't top my car off every single day.  I charge the car at home every two weeks when it hits 20%.   When the power went out, the EV was at 40% charge.   This is roughly 100 miles of range and was more than enough to cover for a few days.  This storm occurred suddenly, and only lasted about 20 minutes but did unthinkable damage here in the suburbs.  I personally have never seen something like this where we live.   4 or 5 confirmed touch downs for tornados.  This is not a hurricane where people are warned over and over again for days until it lands.  There was no real preparation for this.

We have a 4kw gas generator.  It's an older Generac 4000xl.  We have an all electric home so there is no natural gas.

We needed gas for the generator, but the gas stations didn't have power.  Ironically, nobody is getting any gas.  Once the gas stations had power, residents cleaned them out.   The lines for the gas station were so long, police had to direct traffic.   People were panic buying and causing a domino effect.   The three gas stations closest to us were now out of gas.

We had to drive to another city to fill our gas cans.  

On the third day of our ordeal, the EV was down to 25%.   I was running our fridge, our freezer, three aquariums, the TV and the neighbors fridge off of our generator.  We're still not anywhere near 4K watts yet.   We have a 20 amp 4 prong cable that plugs into the generator.  I stopped at home depot and bought a 14-50 plate with a box and fashioned a plug for the EV charger at the end of the generator's 30a cable.

On the Polestar 2's charging interface, you can limit the amps it draws from the charger.  I started with just 5 amps and slowly increased it one at a time until I heard the generator struggle and then backed off.   With everything else I was running, I was able to dedicate 2.8kw of power to the EV.   I let that sit over night and had 65% charge in the morning.   It's slow, but completely viable.  As long as we can power the generator, all of this is a working solution.  There's a joke in there somewhere about burning fossil fuels to charge the EV (for one day, lol)  but I don't let that rhetoric bug me.

We do own a CX5 and worst come to worst, we can drive that.   I didn't want to use the gas in that car since gas was getting pretty scarce to begin with.  I tried to use the EV as much as possible instead.   It's just an option if we had to.  

Now we had a new problem.  Our local grocery stores had no power and all perishables.... perished.    Some stores remained open on a cash basis, but only offered non-perishables.  The panic buyers cleaned out anything of real value.   Bottled water and sports drinks were completely gone as well.   Fortunately, I keep a lot of canned food and we have food stock in a deep freezer.  We're not afraid of tap water either.

On the 5th day we still didn't have power, but many areas of town did.  I stopped by a Sheetz and their level 3 chargers were online.   In 25 minutes, I topped the car off to 90%.   Good for another two weeks.

That week was hard.   Debris, trees, power lines, and telephone poles blocking the streets. Gas stations without power.  Gas stations without gas.  People competing for resources, hoarding, and panic buying.   Empty grocery stores.   We had to cook like we were camping every day.

The one thing that was never really a problem was the EV.

I know that is circumstantial.  We have a generator.  The EV had a decent charge when this happened.   We had a resource that most our neighbors didn't.  However, if Sheetz doesn't have power to charge the EV, they don't have power to pump gas either.   If we can't get gas to power the generator, we can't gas a car either.   Once they had power, gas everywhere was gone in two days, while the chargers still stood.   It's also fair to point out that if I didn't have a generator, I still don't think the EV would have hit zero before Sheetz had power again. 

There is a scenario where none of this is possible.   Many people don't own a generator.   If the power went down, in the entire state, and gas everywhere was gone, you would have a hard time charging an EV.  You would probably have a hard time gassing the car, too.  This wasn't the collapse of the United States or the zombie apocalypse though.  This was a common scenario where a bad storm knocked out power for a week.   If someone lived in an apartment, relied strictly on public charging networks, and left their car at 5% charge they would probably be screwed.

My own personal take away is that I should top the car off more at home.  If a storm is on the horizon, I should prepare a little better. 

My advice to anyone potentially shopping is as such

* Don't do it if you can't charge at home.  It's ridiculously convenient and it costs us $3.80 to charge from 20% to 90%.   If you're willing to deal with 100% public charging then you are braver than I am.   Here electrify America Charger charge us $0.56kwh while our rate at home is $.065kwh.   It costs a little more than $30 to charge our car using their superchargers - about the same as gas
* Depending on the car, you may not need some $600 charging station and $2000 to have it installed at home.    I ran the outlet myself and it was probably $150 in parts only because HD charges too much for small runs of wire.  Find out for what a particular car needs before buying anything.  If you need to upgrade your whole panel that will likely cost a lot of money.  That particular project cost me $1600 for 200a service and 30 breakers.  The service itself was already 200a and did not need upgraded.
* I just told you that the upgrade cost $1600.  I originally didn't do it because the internet told me that would cost anywhere from $4K to $6K.   Don't believe the internet - get quotes yourself.  My electrician was also smart enough to know that if the charging unit has GFCI then its bad to put it on a GFCI breaker and installed it the way the manufacture said instead of arguing semantics about code.
* If you can charge at home, *and* you have a garage or shed to store a small generator, that is a good investment even if your generator sits for 2 years before using it.  It isn't just about the car, but not losing $300 of food in the fridge and $300 in the freezer, and not being hosed because the grocery store ran dry as well.
* If you live in a city like mine with just *one* supercharger, its a good idea to back it up with a gas car.   I am just being practical.

I wrote this a while ago, and there's been a development since.  I learned how to power the entire house with the generator by running a 50 amp cable from the generator to the house's EV plug.  That's right.  I turn off the service shutoff breaker and feed electricity back to the panel via the 50 amp plug in the garage.   I turn off breakers it doesn't have the juice to run like the AC and the range.  I can still trickle charge the EV using the 20a plug exactly the way I was doing it before.   Someday I will upgrade the generator as I would like AC as well.   I read that you're not supposed to do this without an expensive switching system or at least a simple breaker lock that doesn't allow both to be on at the same time.  Safety first of course.

I have also had people suggest that I buy an inverter and I can run the fridge and freezers off of the car itself.  I looked into that.  Unfortunately it looks like the Polestar 2 isn't readily capable of that, as it only charges it's 12v battery while its moving.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1fide15/our_experience_owning_an_ev_and_losing_power_for/

It was supposed to get an upgrade to 325 a few months after I got it, but it never did. Getting a Model Y would mean I'd get another 40 miles of range, since the Y gets 330 when new.
2. My Model 3's efficiency had absolutely gone to shit in recent months. When it was new, I'd regularly get between 200 and 240 Wh/mi on my commute in good weather (depending on traffic), but even in good weather I was regularly getting well over 300 Wh/mi since mid-2022. I think that was a result of using Michelin CrossClimate2 tires, and possibly other factors.
3. I had to bring this car in for a lot of service. The final count of unscheduled mobile service and service center visits was over 10, though one of those was because some ground squirrels that had been infesting my parents' property ate some of my wires... That was an expensive repair, but the rest of the unscheduled service visits were free.
4. The motor's inverter failed back in April 2022, and my car was stranded in the unusually low-roofed parking structure where it happened until the next morning, due to Teslas needing to be towed on flatbeds. Once the car eventually got towed to a service center, they took three weeks to get a replacement inverter installed. It would have been two weeks, except that their first replacement also failed, so they had to wait for another. The car ran flawlessly after that, though.
5. Being a 2018, this Model 3 was missing a lot of the QoL features of modern Teslas. Power trunk, USB-C ports, longer range, better build quality and double-laminated windows (and thus less *wind noise*), improved center console, and a few others.
6. I *hated* the red turn signals on my Model 3 so much that I spent a pretty penny replacing them with aftermarket tail light fixtures that included amber signals. Model Ys have amber turn signals from the factory, and I think modern Model 3s do, too.
7. The wind noise in my 2018 was bad. Like, *real bad*. I'd have to run my podcasts much louder than I liked, just to drown it out. The 2023 Model Y that I test drove was a radically better auditory experience, which is a major factor is making me decide to actually buy one.
8. Rattles. I had one pop up early in the driver-side seatbelt fixture (and thus *right* next to my ear). I fixed it myself, but my fix broke some of the trim connectors for the B-pillar, and that trim piece started rattling a while later. I even brought the car in to Tesla to have them fix that, and they simply failed to do so. The tech told me that such broken connectors were a known-to-be-unfixable problem in early Model 3s. There was also a rattle somewhere up front, possibly in the HVAC system, that absolutely refused to replicate when I'd bring the car in to a service center for them to fix it. This happened three times.

I'd already tried out the EV6, Ioniq 5, and Mach-E last year, when my Model 3 was in the shop for its inverter replacement, and found them all lacking. *Especially* in terms of software, and specifically navigation. None of them wow'd me at all, and none of the other EV offerings available in the US are appealing or within my budget (I'd probably love a Taycan, lol). So to me, ""upgrade"" meant ""new Tesla"", because I have no intention of going back to ICE.

Reasons to buy that I wrote down before making my decision:

* New HOV lane stickers that will last until Jan 2027. My Model 3's stickers just expired.
* 40 miles more range.
* Refreshed warranty.
* Much less wind noise.
* No rattles.
* Power liftgate and much more storage space.
* Improved build quality and newer components (e.g. higher resolution cameras and heat pump).
* New center console design with no piano black.
* New door open buttons which are much clearer for unfamiliar users, due to having a lit ""open door"" icon on them, instead of just a small white line.
* Higher ride height makes it easier to get in and out. Especially important for my aging parents, but quite a nice change for myself, too. 
* Redesigned rear seats that look more comfortable.
* White interior, which includes a white dashboard accent, rather than the wood one in my Model 3 that I don't really like.
* Better for car-camping, largely due to hatch vs. trunk.
* Compatible with the Tesla CCS adapter, which my old Model 3 is not. There's supposed to be a retrofit ""coming soon"", but it's still not available at time of writing.

Reasons not to get a Y:

* Not willing to spring for EAP or FSD, so I'll lose access to auto lane-change and Summon. My Model 3 has FSD, but I don't use the other features.
* Cost. I'll have about a $600/mo car payment again for either the next 4 or 5 years, depending on tax credit.
* Lack of ultrasonic sensors. Supposedly the software-based replacement that uses the cameras for the same purpose is very nearly ready.
* The higher ride height does come at a cost: I cannot see the front of the hood *at all* while seated in the Model Y's driver seat. This makes the lack of USS even more of a potentially serious problem.
* The Y is slightly wider, which will make the lack of Summon that much more of an annoyance due to my cramped carport.
* Tires will likely be more expensive, since the smallest rims available for the Y are 19s, while my Model 3 has 18s. Hopefully the Y's tires won't wear out nearly as fast as my 3's first two sets did (only 20,000 miles each).


I weighed these reasons for a few weeks, and eventually ordered a new Model Y in late January. It was ultimately delivered on March 18th, after I chose to change the color, which pushed delivery back a bit. So I've had my new Model Y for a month, and here are my thoughts:

Model Y Pros:

* Dramatically quieter at freeway speeds, both in terms of wind noise and road noise.
* Powered hatchback is a really nice feature. Never had one before. Not having to *lift* heavy objects in order to get them out the back of the car is super nice.
* Significantly deeper under-trunk storage and side-pockets compared to Model 3.
* I like the updated ""mouse wheels"" on the steering wheels. They have a much more premium feel than the ones on my 2018 Model 3. I rented a 2022 Model 3 for a few days that had the same mouse wheels, so they seem to be standard, now.
* Perfect panel gaps, as far as I could tell after a thorough inspection. This was a Fremont-built Model Y.
* Love the factory chrome delete. Works quite well with the red paint.
* I like having the pedestrian warning sound, which my 2018 Model 3 was too old to have, as it had no exterior speaker.
* I like the higher ride height a lot. Makes it much easier to get in and out of the car, as well as giving a more commanding view of the road.
* The headlights feel better.
* Zero initial quality issues. I brought my Model 3 in for warranty fixes a few times in its first several months of ownership. Things like loose plastic on the gearshift, a wonky mirror motor, and a mildly broken passenger door handle. My Model Y has had absolutely none of that.
* I love the white interior. It really makes the seats POP, and I prefer it over the wood dash trim, too. If it had been offered when I got my Model 3, I would have gotten it then, but they introduced the white a few weeks after my car was delivered. 
* Autopilot is still just as solid in my Y as it was in my 3. I get phantom braking only once a twice a *year*, so it effectively doesn't exist for me. My sole complaint is that in stop-and-go-traffic, Vision-only AP seems a *tad* jerkier than radar-based AP felt back when my Model 3 still had that.


Model Y Cons:

* I thought the view out the back window was bad in the 3. It's *much* worse in the Y. Thankfully the backup camera is outstanding, and can be enabled while driving.
* The hood slopes more than the Model 3, making it harder to tell exactly where the front of the car is from in the driver seat.
* The lack of Summon makes parking at home a lot more annoying. 
* The lack of ultrasonic parking sensors makes having no Summon even more annoying when I'm parking at home. They did finally add camera-based Park Assist a week or so after I picked up the car, though. It seems to work reasonably well, but not quite as well as the USS-based feature in my Model 3 did.
* I miss letting the car handle next-lane traffic for me during a lane change, but I got used to manually re-enabling Autosteer afterward pretty quickly. 
* The seatbelt was a tad uncomfortable, so I got an adjuster clip off of Amazon, which works great.

Other thoughts:

With a new Model Y, I was finally able to get a CCS adapter (my old Model 3 didn't have the appropriate electronics) and try it out at a local Electrify America station. Or rather, two local EA stations, because the first one had a broken charger and was otherwise full due to having only 3 stalls. *Sigh...*

The second one worked fine, though I did get a Windows error message about the machine running out of memory. That didn't seem to affect the charging session, though.

Given all the complaints that non-Tesla owners have in regards to payment at DCFC stations, I was surprised by how easy it was. I plugged in, tapped my phone on the NFC reader, and it charged my default Apple Wallet credit card and started sending electrons within about 30 seconds. I got 130-140kW, and left the station after I got back from the bathroom in the mall where it was located. It cost $13 to charge about 40% of my Model Y's battery ($0.48/kWh).

That said, while I had a flawless experience at that station, a local Ioniq 5 owner did not. He got stuck with a 50 kW capped charger for a bit, and frustratedly moved to two different charge ports before finding one that gave him the full 150kW charge speed that the station was supposed to offer.

Amusingly, one of the electronics cabinets that was feeding this EA station had a big Tesla logo on it. Not sure what sort of device it was, though.

If you have any questions for me about my ownership experience with either the 3 or the Y, please feel free to ask!

EDIT: Since I've been asked a few times, I sold my Model 3 private party for $33,000 (65,000 miles), after Tesla low-balled me on the trade-in offer at $22,800. I used the proceeds from that sale as the down payment for the Y's loan, which I got for 4.75% APR for 5 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/12nld46/i_recently_upgraded_from_a_2018_model_3_to_a_2023/
1eo6m7m,Electric Minivans. Why aren't manufacturers rushing to make EV Minivans?,585,481,1723226754.0,"Why aren't auto manufacturers, anywhere in the world including China where Minivans are seen as luxury, rushing to make electric Minivans? 

They'd be the perfect EV vehicles.

1. Long floor for a giant battery, maybe upto 170kWh batteries, and at EPA rating of 3mi/kWh efficiency, easy to get range of 400mi+.

2. Can be made aerodynamic, unlike trucks and gigantic SUVs which due to their high ground clearance and massive front fascia, get abysmal efficiency.

3. With an optimized powertrain, potentially purchasing from Lucid, you can have a 600hp AWD, electric minivan with 0-60 of sub 5 seconds, going as long as 400miles or more per charge at 70mph speeds.

4. Electric Minivans would have more space than a combustion minivan, massive front truck and seats folding down in the rear, a 7ft or maybe longer flat floor behind the driver and front passenger seats possible.

5. If the battery is in two parts, the middle seats could possibly be stow and go like the Pacifica has, potential of massively capable vehicle.

6. With a Lucid/Rivian/Tesla approach of a software defined vehicle, massive cost cuttings possible on an EV minivan, with reduction of cost in so many separate little control units spread out.

7. An inbuilt vacuum, On-Board power delivery capabilities like the Lightning, Cybertruck, Silverado EV, a perfect vehicle for camping.

8. With the additional strength that a battery pack provides, a minivan with 600hp can be made to tow up to 12500 lbs, potentially able to pull small camping trailers. On camping sites, simply plug in your minivan at the 40amp 240v outlets and you're not getting the smell of burning fossil fuels neither the added heat.

9. You don't even need the camper trailer. Your minivan could be the space you live in! Like those van-build videos that are rampant on YouTube.

10. If battery scaling is achieved, the electric minivan could still be under $60k, cost next to nothing in maintenance, and about 85% lower to fuel than a gas minivan like the Odyssey.

11. In the US, it could become eligible for the $7500 credit, and become even cheaper.

In my opinion, Lucid or Rivian should go after this massive untapped market. Integrate Supercharger access, and you could potentially go from LA to NYC with as little as 6/7 charging stops, and not even spend any money on staying in hotels, just sleep in the minivan with 7ft of flat floor.

2023, minivan sales were about 240k in the US. Most minivan owners, unlike owners for small SUVs, or small sedans, live in homes. Perfect for charging at home. Assuming a 25% market share, Lucid and Rivian have an available market share of at least annual sales of 60k vehicles, and honestly, they could be priced at $70k, and still turn out to be cheaper than the $50k gas Minivans in 5 years.

r2630m,Owned a Lucid Air for 10 days...here are my thoughts,560,259,1637873258.0,"I'm no journalist or claim to be an expert at anything regarding cars, but rather want to share my experience as an owner including all the faults I've experienced driving and owning the Lucid Air.

I took delivery of my Dream Edition on Nov 14, have driven it almost every day since. I've put a little over 450 miles on it, doing only local driving i.e. streets and freeways but nothing long distance (over 50 miles one way).

Interior and drive - we all know this already, but the materials and feel of everything inside makes it a very unique driving experience compared to previous drivers and vehicles I've owned. I've never been much for styling in a car, I've always considered them to be machines to get me from point A to point B, but the Air makes me appreciate the little intricacies and details quite a bit more compared to previous vehicles. We've never owned quite as expensive a car as this, but we have had and driven our fair share of ""nice"" vehicles which include the following: Mercedes S55 AMG, Mercedes S500, BMW 740 iL, Porsche Cayenne S, Tesla Model S (older version), Tesla Model 3, Mercedes CLK Convertible, a good number of Lexus, Hondas, Toyotas... The Lucid is just different, the interior design is exactly what Derek or Peter talked about in their interview. It's a calming driving experience even in the hustle and bustle of driving in Los Angeles. The cabin, is not the quietest out there, but it's definitely been the quietest I've been in for an extended period of time, and it's great. Putting on your latest podcast or playlist you just lose yourself to the drive. The screens are not intrusive and once you get everything set up how you like you just drive.

The drive itself - When journalists talk about feeling the road and getting feedback, the Lucid excels in this regard. The suspension is planted and firm, but also soft and forgiving at the same time. You can feel the road, but you don't feel every bump, it's stiff but not jarring and in smooth mode is comfortable why not feeling like you are floating or disconnected. In Swift mode, the suspension tightens up a little, you get more feeling from the road, the steering tightens up but is still incredibly easy to maneuver. The turning radius is good, bordering on great for a car this size. The car doesn't ever feel like it is a full size sedan even though it is. The feel is like a smaller more nimble vehicle that never feels it's size or weight.

With all that out of the way, how is it to actually drive and live with daily? What issues do I have...not everything is rainbows and unicorns.

I knew being in the first iteration of a vehicle, there would be problems. It's inevitable and there is no such thing as a perfect car, perfect software, or a perfect experience. I don't understand why or how anyone would expect Lucid to get everything right, right away, but the amount of hatred and scrutiny I've seen is unbelievable. I have faith that Lucid will fix the issues, especially any issues with software as that is a fix that is doable OTA. I'll breakdown issues I've experienced and have tried to replicate below:

The most common error I have is with the parking camera and sensor system. As of right now, when entering the car, the bootup sequence takes around 30 seconds to fully load the UI and all accompanying systems. I believe this is due to the car being put into a sleep state to reduce battery drain while sitting parked or idle. When entering the car and before the car is able to fully load, engaging drive or reverse MAY cause the cameras to not load properly. I've had about a 60/40 split on it loading properly prior to full bootup sequence being complete. This is fixed by locking and unlocking the car, which I assume is a system reset.  To add to this, this only happens when I first start up the car in the morning, so after the car has been sitting idle for 8+ hours.  When using the car during the day, the normal startup sequence is closer to 5 seconds.  It seems to take longer the longer the car is not in use.

I've had issues with my Frunk opening from the key fob. It almost always gets stuck on the passenger side latch. A second opening sequence on the fob (which involves just holding down the button) will unlatch the frunk and open normally. Funnily enough, this does not happen when opening the Frunk from inside the car via the pilot panel. This issue has already been reported to Lucid.

Issues with my trunk. I've been able to replicate an issue where, IF the car is not unlocked and you try to open the trunk AFTER you unlock the vehicle, the power trunk will not operate and the trunk close button will not operate. A simple fix is to manually close the trunk, lock the car, unlock the car and it functions as normal again. The trunk close button also has come loose. A technician looked at it and the clip inside broke so that will be replaced the next service visit. There is a seal that has come loose, looks like there was some glue missing in that section and will need to be re-glued. I also took delivery with a blemish in the spoiler section of the trunk lid. The service center, prior to taking delivery, noted this in their file and have ordered a replacement lid because they felt the error could not be corrected via a paint job i.e. it was blemish in the underlying metal.

UI Issues or personal preferences that I feel should be changed. I'm not entirely sure if these issues are by design or some bug in the software, but these things I brought up with the Lucid team as things I would like to see changed:

You cannot have a separate panel loaded in the driver panel and the pilot panel at this time. If you choose maps, it will load maps on both, same goes with Music, or phone, or home. My preference is to be able to keep a map up in the driver panel and have the music or phone loaded on the pilot panel or any combination there of. Currently, because of the ability to ""swipe down"" the different options, it will only allow you to load one item as a time on both panels.

Currently, Homelink is tied to driver profiles. This could be a design choice due to future security implementations with driver profiles, but upon initial setup it surprised me. I only set up my driver profile with Homelink and have not bothered with the other drivers in the family because I did not want to have to go through the same steps 15 more times. I do like how Homelink is geo triggered, so when I pull into my driveway, it brings up the Homelink to select which gate to open.

The NAV audio volume is not adjustable or able to be turned off.

The turn signal audio is quite loud.

I've had some issues with bluetooth audio playback and the Spotify app loaded in the UI. There has been 2 occasions where the car got stuck in a loop trying to play Spotify via bluetooth off my phone or Spotify from the UI. It was corrected by just selecting am/fm radio and going back to the Spotify app. I'm not sure if it's adjustable or not, but the Spotify app in the car does not have an option to have ""random"" skipping during play from a playlist. It will just play in order of the playlist. The search function in the Spotify app is wonky. You can search but once the search returns results and you select something, it will just play that song or first song from the artist instead of letting you go into a sub menu for the artist.

When receiving a text message and using the car's AI to read it back, this will trigger the Spotify app to stop playing. In order to start playback again, I have to go back and select the app and hit play again.

The skip forward and skip back buttons on the steering wheel will skip to the next radio substation. Even after I have setup my favorite stations, my preference would be to skip to the next station on my list, however, as currently setup, it moves forward or back to the next substation.

Because ADAS is not currently enabled on the car, I can't properly review it yet, except I feel Lucid has missed an opportunity to map the left scroll wheel and left button for other functions besides ADAS functions.

The main pilot panel I feel can be improved. Initially, it's great to see the car and background change when you change drive modes, but I would LOVE for that screen real estate to be replaced with something else. My top 2 choices now are the ability to access NAV, music or phone from the pilot panel. A redundancy of being able to access menus would be great.

To address the apparent lagginess of the UI, I posted this response below and I should have included it in my main post:

I think that the screen works great. I've seen the videos where people say it appears laggy, but the way I look at it is that it's a design choice. I think instead of comparing the screen to a Tesla or Iphone, I would say it's more comparable to how in movies, transitions used are different. For example, a cut vs. a fade transition. I feel, though I could be wrong, that Lucid has purposely chosen some effects to be slower and feel more like a fade versus a cut to a new screen. Some functions are much snappier like when certain buttons are triggered whereas other seem to ""flow"" for lack of a better way to describe it. I guess you could say it's more gentle? It's hard to describe, but having used Tesla screens compared to this, it gives off the feeling of not being rushed and is more leisurely. I wouldn't call it lag because it's not choppy.

Overall though, this is really minor nit picky stuff. I've never felt these small issues have affected the quality of the drive or my experience. These can also all be corrected via software and are also personal preference. I understand my desires may not align with Lucid's design view, so in its current iteration, I would be happy with it, even if nothing changed.

I've shown many people the car, talked to many people about it when they come up asking and sitting inside and the comments are all the same. Every single commenter has said how much nicer the car is compared to Tesla, the details, the build quality, the interior. The highest praise I've gotten is when I took the car down to get a quote from a very well known and respected detail and wrap shop. I arrived to get a quote to wrap the car and get it tinted. They had just finished wrapping 2 Ferraris and had a Pagani on the floor. The owner came out and just said ""WOW"" that is a nice looking car. The sales associate with him got inside to look and said ""This is amazing, so much nicer than any Tesla."" Given this shop's track record and cars they've worked on, it's good to hear. 3 detailers who've seen the car up close have commented how the build quality and finish blew Tesla out of the water. One even said that this is the first EV he would consider buying because of the design aspect. I don't include these anecdotes to hate on Tesla, because I still like the cars, but this truly is the next iteration of the luxury EV.

Let me end by saying that the car is appropriately named. It really is the culmination of vision and hard work that have turned the dream into reality. The car is not perfect and I'm sure there will many iterations of software to come, but so far it has been a Dream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/r2630m/owned_a_lucid_air_for_10_dayshere_are_my_thoughts/
1mkorex,"Just drove 2500 miles from Oregon to Alaska in a Kia EV9. If anyone's considering a similar trip, here's how it went:",560,134,1754637962.0,"**Intro + Background**

Hello everyone. I did a lot of poking around on here while researching this trip so I figured it would be be helpful to add my own writeup for people planning in the future, in case it's helpful.

I'm from Anchorage and still have family there. Recently a family member was interested in getting a new EV but the shipping up to Anchorage was problematic and / or expensive - I am not an EV owner and I don't really follow what's going on but sounds like there was some kind of accident or fire with a container ship recently that means that shipping up there either isn't happening or is really pricey.

I needed a break from work and have wanted to do that drive again for a while now, so I agreed to drive it up from where they purchased it in Washington, to Anchorage, through Canada.

We looked at taking the ferry for part of the way - from Bellingham to Haines - but it was also pretty costly and they only sail once a week these days so the timing was a little awkward. I have done that leg in a car in the past (in an ICE car) and it's a blast if you don't mind sleeping on the deck of the ferry, but these days I am not sure my lower back would be too happy with that decision.

So the all-land route it was.

I'll break this down into sections and a day-by-day quick log. Jump around if you want. I really liked having the detail when I was doing my own research so I apologize if it's too nitpicky.

**Summary**

6 driving days, ranging from 5-10 hours drive time. Longest charge time was 4-5 hours, in a town where the fast charger was broken. Typically charged up above 80% given the unpredictability and distances involved in the more remote areas. Didn't ever get stranded but it was a little dicey in spots. Overall much better charging support than I expected, especially in BC, where I feel like the infrastructure is to the point where you don't really have to do much pre planning. No real regrets or big things I'd change.

**Even Shorter Summary**

Fun drive, a little stressful sometimes, worth it, long, beautiful!

**Vehicle**

I drove the 2026 Kia EV9 - I think they have only been out for a very short amount of time. I believe it was the long range model. Like I said, not my car, and I am not an EV guy so I don't know too much about this aspect of it. I know I had to use a CCS charger adapter at almost every stop.

I liked the car a lot. It's pretty huge for a guy like me but for their family with kids I think it makes sense. It has quite a bit of range, realistically, it's only in places like northwestern Canada that you feel it. I really liked the driving assist features - in my day to day I drive a pretty basic (but hey, still great) Subaru without a lot of the bells and whistles. The lane keeping assist or whatever was awesome. Less functional on rougher roads of course but on highways, I could set cruise control and lane assist and pretty much uhhhhhhh let the car drive, not sure if I am supposed to say that.

The one downside is the climate control cuts into the mileage pretty significantly. Took me a couple days to figure this out. Also the charging port is on the opposite side of the car of a lot of other EV’s which makes it a little goofy to orient while parking at a charger that other people are at / may arrive at. But not insurmountable.

**Route**

I took I-5 north through Seattle, then cut east at Bellingham to cross the border in more like Abbotsford than Vancouver itself. From there in order I went through Kamloops, Cache Creek, Prince George, Fort Nelson (skipping Dawson), Watson Lake, Whitehorse, Beaver Creek, Tok, Glennallen, and ended in Anchorage. Stopped more places than that obviously but that will give you something to put into a map.

This was driven by a combination of places I wanted to see, charging places I knew about, avoiding forest fires, trying to stay within some kind of range of services in case of a problem of some sort, and driveable distances. I’ll get into it more in the day-by-day.

**Lodging**

I stayed in a hotel (of some description) every night. If I was to do this again and I had more flexibility, I think staying at RV parks and camping would be a good option because I think a good number of them are starting to or have chargers that charge reasonably overnight. Because I was only driving one-way though, I couldn’t bring all my camping stuff because I wasnt going to be able to take it on the plane on the way back. Or it would have been a giant pain. Plus, again, lower back. But I think you could definitely do this a little cheaper and a little more rustic.

The one pain here is that quite often, I was playing it by ear where I would end up on any given night, due to uncertainty around charger availability and charge time. If I ever showed up and had to wait for someone to charge, or if I needed to charge and the charger wasn’t available for whatever reason, the amount of charge time needed especially further north where the chargers were slower (50kw if you were lucky) meant that it was hard to reserve hotel rooms ahead of time and know for sure you would be there. Day-of is sometimes cheaper if they need to sell a room that would otherwise be empty, but it can be a real roll of the dice.

**Cost**

For 6 nights, charging, food, snacks, coffee, etc. my cost as 1 person was about $1700 USD. Again camping would make this a lot cheaper, and I like to try restaurants when I’m in new places, so you could certainly lower your food costs and be more frugal.

Of that, since charging in Yukon was free, only about $300 was charging expenses. Cheaper than gas for sure.

**Resources**

I used A Better Route Planner which I’m sure you all know about, which was pretty good. Further north I relied more on the official apps of the charging utilities - BC Hydro, and Flo in the Yukon. I also started relying on stopping in at every town’s visitor center and talking to the desk staff - they are quite often across developments in the EV charging area much earlier than some of the other resources. Things like Oh yeah, they just put in a new charger at Johnsons Crossing! or “I think that RV park has a fast charger now actually.” that maybe weren’t on other resources yet.

One challenge here is that the Kia was not linked up with A Better Route Planner so ABRP couldnt access my real-world driving efficiency data and adjust its predictions and routing advice. There were a couple times when I input the days travel into ABRP just to back-check it, and ABRP assumed I should have arrived in a town with 25% battery left and I showed up with 6%. For example. Normally not an issue but in the areas with big stretches between chargers… a little harrowing.

I also used the Milepost, which I got a physical copy of, and flipped through at charging stops to see if there were any points of interest coming up. I would recommend doing this as well. They have pretty good EV charging information in there too since they update it every year.

**Daily Outline**

Quick outline of each day, where I charged, and also non-logistical highlights of the day for your traveling consideration.

**Day 1 - Portland to Kamloops BC**

Started off early ish in Portland, and stopped just north of Seattle (I used to live in Seattle and boy I do not miss the traffic) to charge at a Tesla supercharger. It was on the map as being east of the highway, but all I saw over there were regular chargers, which do not work with the Kia despite the plug fitting. Stuff you guys probably already know. So I bopped across the highway and with a little maneuvering found a row of superchargers in a parking lot of like a totally nondescript office building. This was my first time ever charging any kind of EV so it was a learning curve. I had to download the Tesla app and make an account, which was annoying. First time also using a charging adaptor but once I got the hang of it it went swimmingly. Charged for about 30 minutes I think to get back up to 80%. In the meantime I went into the lobby of the office building to find a bathroom - it was code locked but I just did the classic wait for someone to come out and pretend you were just about to go in move and it worked great.

Crossed the border near Abbotsford. Some questions regarding the newness of the vehicle but overall fine. One interesting note: the Kia does not switch its displays to kilometers automatically, but the display does change its speed limit guidance to a conversion from KM. A little funky but for example, in a 100km/h speed zone, the display still shows your speed in Miles per hour, but the little speed limit sign on the dash says Speed Limit 62MPH (the conversion from KM). I assume you can change this in the settings but I didn’t want to dick around with it and it worked well enough. Hung a right to head for Kamloops, and stopped pretty quick in Chilliwack to add some more juice - this was an “On the Go” charger in the parking lot of a gas station / convenience store. Worked reasonably well.

I headed for Kamloops because it was the biggest city near ish to my route and I figured had the best odds of having a decent hotel room available. I don’t know what’s going on in that town but boy they sure love hotels there - there are a gazillion. I pulled in late-ish and was able to get a room at the Doubletree - there were two EV charging spots out front where I could have charged overnight but since I got in late, they were both taken. Nice hotel, nice room, everything besides bars was closed for the evening though so I just went to bed.  
  
**Day 2 - Kamloops to Williams Lake to Prince George**  
  
Got up early-ish and found a charger in town to plug the car in at while I went and had breakfast. Had a pretty good sun dried tomato + asiago benedict at Hello Toast. It was busy but I sat at the bar and eventually got served - very tasty stuff. The breakfast potatoes were incredible. Then I moseyed back through town and looked around, passed through the farmers market, retrieved the car, and headed out to Williams Lake, the rough midpoint between Kamloops and Prince George, the goal for the evening. 

Note - at this point I was hoping to push a little past Prince George, but there was no real logical next town that made sense. If you look at the total mileage to Anchorage you’d like to divide it up into pretty even chunks but what I found was that the population centers with fast chargers are not really spread out like that. So Day 2 was a shorter day than I might have liked - if spacing was a little better, or I was camping, I definitely could have equalized the days a little better with that added flexibility.

Williams Lake was an interesting little town at the confluence of two rivers. Beautiful scenery in this part of BC that reminded me of eastern Oregon and Washington. Dry golden browns, bluffs, water. Unfortunately they put the chargers in the ass ends of some of the weirdest parking lots in BC so my half thought through plan of “Park to charge for a bit and walk around looking at the town” did not really work. Instead I got a disgusting drink at Tim Hortons and wandered around looking at some First Nations interpretive installations and eavesdropped on everyone in a Tesla charging at the same bank of superchargers. Could be worse!  
  
On the way out of town (kinda) I stopped for coffee at Logjam. Great little shop, great vibes, great coffee, very weirdly shaped iced drink cup that did not fit that great in a cupholder, but it’s all part of the vibes.  
  
Next stop was Prince George for the evening. I got a room at the Hyatt Place there, which again, had a couple of EV chargers in the lot that were available in theory but busy when I got there. Bad luck.  
  
I had quite an evening here - went to the Twisted Cork, it was a bit of a quiet night initially but Mike the bartender was great to talk to (possibly slightly too energetic but what’s one dropped bottle at the end of the day) and made some delicious drinks. I had the scallops and risotto, and the caesar salad, both of which were very tasty. Got to talking to another solo traveler at the bar, we had another drink or five and ended up playing blackjack at the local casino til last call. My new friend was a real pro and I think turned her $100 into $110. Fun night. Funny little town.  
  
**Day 3 - Prince George to Fort Nelson**

Note here: I decided to go up 97 instead of the Cassiar for a couple reasons. One, there were some fires brewing on 37 that I didn’t like the looks of. Two, the chargers were more spread out on the Cassiar, and I was still a little gun shy about being so far from towns and services. 97 is more populated along this stretch although that’s not saying a ton. I believe the Cassiar is much more scenic, though.

This was a long-ass day, with two charging stops planned, and a nice little hangover to boot. Grabbed a plate of eggs at the hotel. Had to top off in the morning at a BC Hydro charger on the edge of town, in the community college parking lot. Got coffee at The Open Door Cafe on the way out of town, which was totally passable. Tons of local art and crafts for sale there which is cool.  
  
The first haul was Prince George to Chetwynd, a small little town that is famous for its chainsaw carving competition. Had lunch at A&W here while charging at the visitors center (BC Hydro). Beautiful scenery, you are kind of following a valley along this leg with lots of farms and forest and some great terrain change that offers some real sweeping views.

Via Hudsons Hope, I cut off the corner that would have taken me to Dawson City - this only saved a little bit of time, so if you are interested in sightseeing and are at a more leisurely pace I think it’s definitely worth a jaunt into Dawson to poke around. Beautiful scenery through by Hudsons Hope though, including a big dam project and some killer views up and down a river valley. Hopped on the Alaska Highway (Finally!) and the next stop was a BC Hydro near Wonowon. As I was pulling in to the chargers area I noticed two dudes in I think a teal Chevy Volt with a decal on the side that said “Bolt to the Arctic Circle.” Not sure what they were up to but if they’re on this subreddit - Whats up guys  
  
This stretch is scenic in a totally different way - it’s definitely starting to feel very northern. You can tell the soil is not deep - all the trees stop growing at a very specific height - and things feel muddy, boggy in a way. Thunderstorms. Not a ton of mountainous terrain yet. Most of what you see along the highway here are motels, abandoned motels, turnoffs for natural gas facilities, and work camps. There are a ton of giant pickup trucks around here full of sunburned men and welding gear.

I had my eye on a hotel in Fort Nelson that supposedly featured an abandoned tiki lounge, but when I pulled into town, the hotel was dark and locked. Someone saw me at the door and came to the door and told me “You can check in, but we’re closed tomorrow.” I didn’t really like the sound of waking up in a closed hotel, not even really sure what that would mean, so I backtracked a quarter mile up the main drag and got a room at the Woodlands Inn and Suites. Totally serviceable hotel. Very big. Lots of kids running through the lobby yelling which I knew because they put me in a ground floor room immediately adjacent to the lobby. But it’s all good, it’s all love. Had a very questionable chicken caesar salad at the Boston Pizza up the road.   
  
No EV plugs at the hotel but a BC Hydro fast charger in town.

**Day 4 - Fort Nelson to Watson Lake**

Woke up early again eager to hit the road. This day was probably the highlight in terms of things seen. Charged the car up at the BC Hydro fast charger while chomping down some McDonalds breakfast and a “Long Espresso” which they gave me in the type of cute to go espresso cup that would cause a security incident if it was ever handed to an average American McDonalds customer at an average American McDonalds.

Next charge stop was Toad River Lodge, another one of dozens of funny gas station / motel combos that exist in this part of the world. Had some decent coffee. Wandered around. Moseyed. Took some pictures. BC Hydro fast charger again. The BC Hydro fast chargers are pretty plentiful, even this far north, and most of them advertise 150kwh which is nice and zippy.  
  
This section is crossing into and within the Canadian Rockies, so the scenery starts to get pretty dramatic again. I did succumb to the temptation to stop and take pictures of vistas every 10 minutes. The joys of road tripping by yourself. You pass Muncho Lake for a stretch here, which has incredibly dramatic teal colored water.

Next stop was probably the highlight of the trip and another reason I took 97 instead of the Cassiar - Liard Hot Springs. A day use area with a cool bathing structure (changing rooms and benches) built into a natural hot springs. Stinky, but a real treat and a real unique area. Tons of folks were congregating here, including a few Quebecois dudes on motorcycles I had spotted at the A+W in Chetwynd, and I think the same dudes in the teal Volt. Again, not sure. Dudes, let me know.Look up some pictures of this place and definitely consider adding it to your route.

Stop for the night was Watson Lake. I realized that basically every successive town heading north, pulling into the town I had been like “Wow, this place is really fuckin tiny” only to then drastically revise my expectations downwards when I got to the next, even incredibly tinier, town. Watson Lake is basically a wide spot with a few motels along the highway. And a visitors center, where the charger lived. I was in the Yukon territory by now - no more fast BC Hydro, I was stuck with 50kwh Flo chargers. Fortunately, the government of Yukon made all the chargers free to use. Unfortunately, they were pretty slow.   
  
I left the car charging and walked across the highway to the Sign Post Forest - a grove of trees where almost 80 years worth of travelers have hung up signs and license plates, whatever, commemorating their journeys through. Unexpectedly very moving. I spent an hour just wandering around here, reading signs from people who had passed through decades ago and had more than likely passed on. Bring a sign of your own and definitely plan to stop here.  
  
I got a room at A Nicer Motel in the strip of motels - as far as I could tell they all looked pretty similar. Again a nice functional room, nothing flashy. I think based on reading google reviews of places a lot of people had higher expectations for rooms, and I could envision a world in which I thought these rooms were crummy. But at the end of the day they were quiet and clean and the plumbing worked. So.

Had dinner at The Nugget, a Chinese place. Haven’t had Chinese food of that particular kind - your classic 90's American Chinese food - since I was a kid growing up in Anchorage, so it was pretty nostalgic. Up in this area the similarities between Alaska and this part of Canada were really hitting me - weird little frontier places that basically only exist because of a big resource extraction boom 50-100 years ago and are somehow still hanging on.  
  
Anyway.  
  
**Day 5 - Watson Lake to Whitehorse**

Every night at the hotel I would do a little research and fine-tuning on the route ahead the next day, mostly so I could have the most current wildfire information. The night before is when I had noticed ABRP distance guidelines and route planning were way more optimistic than distances and charge levels I was hitting in the real world. I started to worry a little bit - there’s a leg on this trip when you hit Alaska where you really do not have any intermediate points and pretty much have to have a 100% charge to make it from Beaver Creek to the next charger. The distances I had been hitting and the car was telling me it was capable of, I was not going to make that leg, even at 100%. Light freakout moment, but I decided to dedicate Day 5 to some serious data checking. By which I mean I busted out a pen and pad, wrote down the actual distance between some stops, wrote down the ABRP prediction, wrote down my car’s start levels and the car’s prediction of miles remaining, and then did it all again at every stop and used good old fashioned arithmetic to see how much the car was off by.

Topped off again at the visitors center charger in the morning, then hit the road. The first stop was Rancheria Falls - no charger here but a quick 10 minute walk along some very nice boardwalks to see a cool series of waterfalls in the woods. I am a little bit spoiled living in Oregon but these were quite nice. Took a photo of a couple on their way from Edmonton to visit their son in Whitehorse.

The math here said the car was optimistic by about 25%. Not as bad as I thought, and a short distance, but still worrying. For the next leg I cut the climate controls completely to see if that would help.

It sure did.  
  
Originally my thought was to try and make it to Johnsons Crossing in one leg without stopping to charge, because the distance was pretty comparable to the worrisome leg from Beaver Creek to Glennallen. But the charger in Johnson was super slow - i think it was a 25 - and as the day wore on and I checked my math with pen and paper at every stop I got less worried. I had figured out the AC was a massive impact on efficiency, and with the AC off, I was actually often *beating* the car’s estimates. So leaving from Beaver Creek with a 100% charge and no AC usage would actually give me a very comfortable buffer to get to the charger in Glennallen.

So I stopped at Teslin and used the fast (“fast”) charger at the marina there. Left the car charging, crossed the highway for a pretty passable clubhouse sandwich and fries at the restaurant there. Restaurant was quite busy!

Left on about an 80% charge for the leg to Whitehorse. Aimed for the Flo fast charger at the Whitehorse Transporation Museum - at this point again I was kind of high-centered in terms of timing. Part of me really wanted to push to Beaver Creek and cut a day off the trip and get home a little earlier, but the chargers in Yukon were really not fast enough to make that a reality without planning to pull into Beaver Creek at like 11PM with no hotel reservation and no camping gear. And also - all the fast chargers in Whitehorse were down that day anyway. As I was pulling in to the fast charger at the visitors center, a guy in the next stall over waved me down - he lives in town, and told me that all the fast chargers were not really functional at delivering 50kw and most of them were stuck at more like 12 for various reasons. He had theories. Not sure. But there were plenty of like, 7kwh chargers that were still paid for by the Yukon government. So I hooked up to one and planned to spend the night in Whitehorse.

This town broke the every-town-is-tinier trend. Wow, it really reminded me of Anchorage. Architecturally and vibes wise. They have a beautiful river front path, it seems to be a jumping-off point for outdoor activities like hunting, mountain biking, etc in the area, so it was full of like, young adventure type people. Bend Oregon vibes. Sorry for saying Vibes again. I got a room at the Sternwheeler, after calling around to about five other places that were already full. Then I went and put my name in at Gather, had a drink and some decent tempura green beans at the hotel across the street while I was waiting, then had some kind of delicious ahi / guacamole situation with a marg at Gather, and a couple more drinks at the Woodcutter’s Blanket up the road.   
  
Talked to some interesting folks at the bar, including an older couple from Alberta on their first road trip in 40 years, and a young man who had just gotten laid off from his job in fuel cells. Always sit at the bar and talk to people IMO. 

Car was just reaching 90% ish at this point, five hours later. Back to the hotel and conked out.  
  
**Day 6 - Whitehorse to Beaver Creek**

Another short-ish day because of the timing of charging, so I planned to take it easy and give myself plenty of stopping time. Good thing too because this is probably the most or second most scenic leg of the drive. Got breakfast at The Open Door, a fascinatingly busy coffee shop where they’ve got a real streamlined operation happening. Whitehorse is a very interesting place, I would love to go back and spend more time there and figure out the vibes. It’s definitely a major regional hub of some kind.

Short, mountainous, beautiful leg to Haines Junction - another spot I had considered pushing on to and staying at the previous night if the car had charged faster. Pulled up to the fast charger at the visitors center and for the first time in the trip, had to wait in line for someone else to finish charging. Another couple in a Tesla pulled in a few minutes later, we chatted for a bit, they said they had just been in Whitehorse and all the fast chargers were working fine and they were a little insistent. Not really sure what to do with that information but I hit them with a “Huh that’s crazy.”

Very cool visitors center here. Tons of info on geology of the area, the mountains, icefields, First Nations people, the whole deal. Overheard a First Nations fella from the eastern side of Canada talking to one of the local First Nations guys about the differences in how their treaties were set up, how they handled certain things, so on and so forth. Cool moment to eavesdrop in on for a white boy like me.

After charging up to 80%, I went and grabbed a coffee and snack at the coffee shop / bakery in town. Very cute little place with an awesome patio - I should have stopped and had real lunch and enjoyed it a bit more but I was not feeling amazing from the night before.

Continued on. This segment is definitely the most bonkers scenery of the whole drive. Take your time here if possible. The road got pretty bad around Destruction Bay, which I was expecting since I talked to a bunch of the visitor center people along the way. It’s built on permafrost so in the spring it heaves like crazy, not much they can really do about that. Definitely need to be prepared to slow down, there are some wild dips.

Pulled into Beaver Creek around 5pm maybe, hit the charger at the visitors center. Another slow one so no chance of scooting out early since I pretty much needed to be at 100% to feel good about continuing to Glennallen without problems. Asked the visitors center attendant about motels, got told there were only three so I was in luck in that it would be easy to choose. One was full, one was disrecommended by the lady I talked to, so I got a little cabin out back of Buckshot Betty’s. Decent enough little spot but god I wish they had put a fan in the room. it was real stuffy. Had an OK burger at the restaurant, some good fries, sat next to a shockingly vulgar Canadian fella who seemed to take offense to the fact that I scooted down the bar to give him and his buddy a little more elbow room. Whatever.

Returned to the visitors center on foot to sit in the car for another hour while it chugged up to 100% ever so slowly. By the time I got back to the cabin it was cooling off a bit but still quite toasty in there. Took a cold shower to cool down and passed out surprisingly easily.  
  
**Day 7 - Beaver Creek to Anchorage**  
  
Woke up early, got coffee at a place across the street, it was fine, hit the road. Roads still quite bad and lumpy in this area. No real cell service once you leave town for quite a ways. Border crossing was very quick and easy, and I laughed at how much better the road instantly got. Some construction in the area (hence the good roads I guess) and had to wait for pilot cars a couple of times, but overall pretty quick through here. Quite beautiful again, this whole day was.

Got to Tok midmorning, stopped for coffee and a snack. I had been keeping my eye on a big fire in the area that looked like it was threatening the town and possibly to close the cut down to Glennallen, which would have detoured me up around through Delta Junction and then down the Richardson. Not a ton longer but not time I wanted to spend. 7 days on the road is a long time. Fortunately, there had been a giant downpour in the area the day before and the fire was totally out. God loves me.

Continued on to Glennallen, pulling in around 1130. No state or federal funding in this great nation of ours for charging infrastructure - this one was hilariously tucked in the back parking lot of a log cabin Subway, right next to a dumpster. Sure says something about something, I bet. Brief moment of panic when the CCS charger wouldn’t start charging, but downloaded yet another fucking charging network app and eventually got it to start charging. 50kw again. Not really “Fast” but at this point I only had 180 miles to go to Anchorage. Rather than eat at Subway I hiked up the road a bit to the Caribou motel where there was a cafe. Had a pretty great grilled cheese sandwich and a pretty decent bowl of tomato soup and a pretty weird salad.

Hit the road with about 85%. 

No more charging stops til Anchorage. The section of highway between Glennallen and Palmer is again some of the most beautiful on the whole trip, despite the rainy weather. Finally saw a moose.

Arrived in Anchorage on about 17%. Good enough!

**Trip Highlights**  
  
\- Liard Hot Springs, number one with a bullet  
\- Canadian Rockies scenery  
\- Spending way too much on good food and booze at The Twisted Cork  
\- Signpost Forest  
\- Kamloops... something about that area really spoke to me. Would like to go back.  
\- Logjam Coffee  


That's it! Hope this helps someone in the future. It sounds like Canada is really rolling out some more EV capabilities as we speak, so the chunk of the drive in the Yukon especially should be getting less stressful every day.

It just bugs me so much. Tesla makes decent cars and they were a pioneer in the industry. As someone who used to be a big fan (who now owns an Ioniq 5), I think it's important to break out of the idea that they're the only option or that other EV makers are somehow massively inferior. Not everyone has the same needs. For some people, the Chevy Bolt is both a decent car and exactly what they need. The Ioniq 5 hit all my important points while being at a price I could afford. Recently I was driving in a Model Y for an Uber out of town and I was shocked at both how loud it was in terms of road noise and how cheap it felt on the interior. I get it; Tesla is still far ahead in terms of technology and for a lot of people that's the most important thing, but to claim they are the end all be all is both not true and harmful for adoption. Tesla makes great cars that are right for many people. So do a lot of other companies and those numbers are just going to keep increasing.

That's not even getting into the cult of many Tesla owners and the absolute nonsense that Musk is spewing lately, making me want to stay away from the brand even if they were the best out there.

ETA: I'm not bashing Tesla; I'm just saying that people have different needs and Tesla's don't meet everyone's needs and there are other options. The supercharger network is an advantage but a vastly overrated one. The one area where I think Tesla has a huge leg up over legacy cars is the direct sales model. Dealers need to die.

My wife and I were looking to replace her 2016 Nissan Sentra with an SUV as she wanted more space for our frequent road trips from San Antonio to Louisiana. Since her vehicle would be the long distance one, we were looking into PHEVs that way I could get a BEV in 5 years when it’s time to replace my car, and hopefully in 10 years when it’s time to replace her car, we would go full BEV when the technology caught up. I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u9hhxo/has_anyone_had_recent_success_getting_a_new_phev/) asking about MSRP dealers for PHEVs and got inundated with comments saying to just buy a BEV.

After a week of researching, comparing it to the EV6 and other EVs, we went ahead and bought an SE RWD. To be clear, if there was a PHEV version of the I5, we would have gotten that instead. But regardless, after over a month and over 3,000 miles, here are 10 things to consider before buying a BEV for road trips.

#1. My actual road trip range is less than half of the listed 300 miles

The EPA estimated range of the Ioniq 5 RWD is 303 miles, but this drops significantly on the highway. Driving around 80mph, my efficiency is around 2.4mi/kWh (u/Willman3755 did a fantastic [roll-down test](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u8enlo/i\_did\_rolldown\_testing\_on\_the\_ioniq\_5\_to\_create/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf) with an Ioniq 5 AWD and my real-world experience in my RWD has matched his results extremely closely.) On a 77.4kWh battery, that’s only around 186 miles. And that’s from 100% to 0. On a road trip, you’re typically limited to using about 70% of your battery (the 10-80%) as your charging speed drops significantly past 80%. So that 186 miles is really about 130 miles between stops. And that’s assuming there’s a charger at that distance. My route has chargers spaced roughly 60 miles apart. Despite the 300 mile listed range, my car can’t really make it to a charger 180 miles away, so I’m stuck stopping every 120 miles or so. At 80 mph, that’s a stop every hour and a half. Keep in mind, this is in the south, where temperatures have been warm, so I’m not losing any range for the cold. Just a bit for the A/C.

It’s about 480 miles from Baton Rouge, LA to our house in San Antonio, TX and we make this drive pretty frequently. A person brand new to BEVs might look at the I5’s 300 mile range and expect to be able to make the trip with just one stop about the halfway point. But this is what my most recent trip was actually like.

55 miles to first stop in Lafayette to charge from 14%-74% (there are no DCFCs in BR so we started with about 40% SoC): 19 minutes total (16 minutes charging, plus 3 minutes to switch chargers as the first was only giving 100kw. 

120 miles to 2nd stop in Vidor to charge from 7%-66% (Every stop this trip, the speed dropped to 30kw after adding about 59% to the battery): 14 minutes total

12 miles to 3rd stop for Fuzzy’s Tacos: 3 minutes total

75 miles to 4th stop in Houston to charge from 13%-72%: Total time 16 minutes

40 miles to 5th stop in Katy to charge from 54%-83% (This was the last known working EA station on our route home, so we needed to stop here in case the one in Columbus was out): 14 minutes as we only got 100kw speeds

45 miles to 6th stop in Columbus to charge from 58%-81%: Total time 20 minutes. Only two stations of the 4 were working, so we wasted time trying the two broken ones, and a Kona was using the 350kw, so we were stuck with 150kw. Mainly happy that it worked at all.

140 miles to home and arrived with 3% battery after dropping speeds for the last 70 miles.

A trip that normally takes about 6.5 hours including gas, food, and restroom stops took us about 8 hours despite the good charging speeds. And that still beat the ABRP estimate. Keep in mind the charging stop times do not include time to actually get to the chargers which are further off the road than typical gas stations.

#2. Highway efficiency is as important as range and charging speeds for road trips. Knowing your car’s miles/minute charge rate is more important than its kw rate.

Let’s say you routinely take 1200 mile road trips and you’re looking at two BEVs.

Car A: 200 mile highway range using 70% of the battery. Average charging speed 200kw. 70% battery capacity 125kWH

Car B: 150 mile highway range (at 70%). Avg charging speed 150kw. 70% battery capacity 50kWH.

On the surface, Car A looks like the clear winner. Longer range, faster charging speed, bigger battery. But Car B has the significant advantage of highway efficiency, getting 3mi/kWh vs Car A’s 1.6mi/kWh. This means that Car A only charges at a rate of 5.33 miles/min while Car B charges at 7.5 miles/min. Car A would need to stop 5 times to charge for 37.5 minutes each for a total of 187.5 minutes while Car B would need to stop 7 times to charge for 20 minutes each for a total of 140 minutes. Even if we add 10 minutes extra for each stop, Car B would make the trip faster by about half an hour. Make sure to verify your car’s highway efficiency numbers when looking for a road trip BEV.

A car like the 2020 Ioniq isn’t seen as a great road tripper due to the 170 mile range and 50kw charging speed. But with a tested highway efficiency of 4.5mi/kWh, its highway range doesn’t fall off a cliff like many cars and it has the added bonus of being able to maintain its miles/minute charge rate using any DCFC 50kw and up. You can regain about 120 miles of range in 30 minutes. The upcoming Silverado EV claims 400 mile range with a 200kWh battery. If its highway efficiency is actually 1.5mi/kWh (very possible considering the enormous battery size), then it’s actual highway range at 70% would be 210 miles. If you get stuck on a 150kw charger (see number 7), and you’re only charging at a rate of 160kw, it would take you about 30 minutes to recoup 120 miles of range, about the same as the Ioniq. That’s not to say that the Ioniq is as good of a road tripper as the Silverado, but the real-world difference might not be as much as you think. Especially considering the Ioniq’s mile/min charge rate would be triple the Silverado’s if they’re both at a 50kw.

#3. EV charge stations are pretty terrible compared to gas stations

Most aren’t covered, so you get soaked in the rain and baked in the sun. They aren’t pull-through like gas stations so it’s often pretty awkward getting your car oriented to charge. Not only do I have to back in (which is not that simple with some Walmart parking lots being one-ways with the parking spots meant to be driven in forward), I have to hope that the charger is on my passenger side for the stations that aren’t right behind you. For [my first ever charge](https://imgur.com/a/OJluUg1) I had to park in a spot that wasn’t even technically for EVs just to get the charger to reach. Or just [look at how this car had to park](https://imgur.com/a/AujnY7s) to access this station. Now imagine if there were other cars parked in the other stations already. Since the cables are often pretty short, you’re basically out of luck. I have no idea how people with trailers are supposed to charge at most of these stations. Plus, I’ve never needed a Shell or Exxon app to refuel my car, but I now have to have apps for all of the different charge stations that I use. I’ve seen several new owners on the phone with others trying to get help with getting the station to work. And that’s not even mentioning how often a station is randomly down or has slow speeds with no warning. Additionally, I feel significantly less safe at EV stations than at gas stations. If I pull up to a gas station at night and there’s sketchy characters around, I can just drive to another nearby. If I pull up to a EV station in the dark corner of a Walmart parking lot at night, I don’t have much choice but to plug in and hope for the best. Not only am I stuck there for significantly longer than a gas station, I also don’t have the option of just driving away if someone is approaching who looks like they have bad intentions. If the car is plugged in, it literally cannot start. And there is no Ejecto Chargo button to try and get away. You’re a sitting duck. And since EVs are still pretty expensive, this may become an obvious target for people looking to make an easy score. Unlike most gas stations which tend to be open 24 hours, most Walmarts are closed overnights, so that 2am charge becomes even less comfortable. 

#4. Road tripping an EV can be more expensive than gas

This greatly depends on your car and where you’re road tripping, but in general, DC fast charging isn’t much cheaper than gas. Electrify America charges $0.43/kWh. At 2.4mi/kWh, it costs about $0.18 per mile to road trip an Ioniq 5. My Ford Fusion Hybrid gets 40mpg at 80mph. Gas prices in my area are around $4.40, meaning the Fusion costs about $0.11 per mile. The Ioniq 5 is about 60% more expensive. There’s a $4 a month subscription to bring the price down a bit, but I’d need to drive about 1000 miles a year to break even, and then after the discount I’m still paying $0.13 per mile. Obviously, this depends heavily on several factors, including the car’s efficiency, gas prices in the area, charging prices in the area (Texas and Louisiana charge by the minute, so the Ioniq 5 is actually significantly cheaper on my route), and any possibly incentives like the free charging for 2 years that we got with the purchase. But it’s an important consideration when calculating the cost savings of an EV. If you’re comparing a BEV with a hybrid or PHEV, your gas savings may not be as much as you expect if a significant portion of your miles come from road trips. 

#5. Even if charging an EV was as fast as filling a gas car, many EV road trips would still take longer

There are DCFCs along most major interstates, but the fastest routes aren’t always along those interstates. For example, when visiting Baton Rouge from San Antonio, we typically stop off in Opelousas to visit some family. It is significantly faster to take 190 after Lake Charles and then stay on 190 into Baton Rouge. Instead, we now have to go out of our way to Lafayette to charge before going to Opelousas, and then back to Lafayette after leaving Opelousas to charge again because Baton Rouge does not have a single DCFC. This problem is exacerbated when travelling from Dallas to Opelousas as the fastest route through Shreveport is impossible with the current charging infrastructure. This means we have to take a route 2 hours slower just to not be stranded.  Combine this with the previous detour and we’re easily adding 5 hours to a round trip without even factoring in charging time. I know a lot of people in this sub think the real road trip isn’t the destination but is actually the Walmarts you meet along the way, but for frequent, repetitive road trips that don’t have good scenery, this is a lot of extra time in the car. 

When comparing travel times, always make sure to put in a round trip to ABRP with the start and end destination at your house and a waypoint at your actual destination. This ensures that you’re factoring in time to charge for the way home as well. Also make sure to check the travel time vs Google Maps. A round trip from San Antonio to Denver is around 27 hours in Google Maps, but 34 hours with ABRP. Only 3.5 of the 7 hour difference is charge time. The other 3.5 hours is due to the slow driving needed just to make it to the chargers. You need more than just time spent charging to calculate the true time loss of road tripping a BEV.

#6. There are some places that you may not be able to go

Charging infrastructure is improving, but there’s still a long way to go. My wife was considering taking our niece to South Padre Island, so she plugged in a round trip from San Antonio into ABRP. No valid routes. We looked at Plugshare and confirmed that it simply wasn’t realistic to try and make it there and back in her car without putting ourselves in some sketchy situations. In your area this may be a non-issue, but there are still many rural places that an EV can’t get you just yet.

#7. Assume you’ll be charging at 150kw, even if your car can take more. You’re more likely to be “ICEd” by an EV.

Every EA station on my route has 4-6 stations with only a maximum of 2 being 350kw. And you can almost guarantee that if people are there, they’re going to be using the 350s. I’ve already had many instances of being stuck on 150kw charger become some Bolt or ID.4 was taking the 350kw charger for no apparent reason. I’ve seen a Polestar roll up to a site with 5 empty stations and still plug in to the one with a Chademo because forget Leaf owners I guess. And I’ve already seen multiple instances of L2 chargers being blocked by Teslas that aren’t even plugged in. There’s a good chance that if a charger you need is being blocked, it will be another EV doing it. With gas, if someone is blocking a station, you just pull into one of the other 16 at that gas station, or just go to another if they’re all full. Personally, I would like to see an additional fee get added to 350kw stations. Maybe $0.05 per minute. That way cars that can’t benefit from the extra speed of the 350s have an incentive not to use them. 

#8. Be prepared for the possibility of long lines at charging stations during an upcoming holiday season

Obviously nobody can predict the future, but as many in this sub point out, EV adoption is picking up extremely quickly. Currently there are only 3 CCS DCFC sites with 150kw units in the entire state of Louisiana. EA currently doesn’t show any plans to add additional chargers in Louisiana on I-10, so those 3 sites will need to serve all of the traffic passing through Louisiana for the foreseeable future. 2 of the 3 sites only have 4 stations. Let’s assume the average car takes 30 minutes to charge (some are faster, but some are slower and since it may be cold during Christmas, 30 minutes is actually being generous). This means a site with 4 stations can only charge 8 cars per hour. With the increased non-Tesla EV sales, the reduced range and increased charge times during the winter, and the increase in traffic during the holiday seasons, it’s entirely possible that sites could face a bottleneck where the rate of cars needing to charge surpasses the capacity of the site. Especially considering these sites have to serve traffic travelling in both directions and you can’t exactly just go to another if the site is full. If over a 10 hour period, a 4 station site gets 10 cars per hour, you’re looking at a 2.5 hour backlog. I’m already seeing photos spread around this sub of full charging stations. Will this be an issue this year? Maybe not. But it could pose serious problems in 2023 or even 2024. Many MV electrical distribution equipment have 18-24 month lead times, so if adding more sites to a route isn’t already in EA’s plan, there’s a good chance it won’t happen until 2025 at the earliest. I’m an electrical engineer currently working on a project that involves installing [battery electric locomotives](https://www.up.com/media/releases/battery-electric-locomotive-nr-220128.htm) for a rail company and we’re targeting an end of 2024 completion date partially due to long equipment lead times. If the utility needs to make substation improvements, it could be even longer. EA may have deals in place that allow them to acquire the necessary equipment more quickly, but if adding more sites in a particular area isn’t already in the works, I wouldn’t expect to see it happen for quite awhile.

#9. Your car’s needs now have to be factored into your plans

I’m sure there were a few people who read the paragraph about needing 6 stops and wondered why I didn’t just get food during one of the stops or pick out a hotel that had EV charging so we didn’t have to leave at 40% SoC. The simple answer is that we have already established hotels and food places that we like for this trip. Many EV owners just take it as a given that they’re going to choose whatever hotel in the area has charging or that they can just eat whatever is close while the car is charging. But I don’t want my car’s needs dictating where I stay or what I eat. It already dictates where I stop. In all my years of travelling this stretch I would never voluntarily stop in Vidor, TX for example, but the car doesn’t give you many options. Not a huge deal, but something to consider. 

#10. Extra passengers impact range and efficiency

I realize initial reactions to this may be “well duh” but impacting range and efficiency is a bigger deal in an EV than a gas car. I can drive about 540 miles on a tank in my Fusion Hybrid, so losing 10% for adding a passenger doesn’t change much. I’m still stopping for gas only once during the 480 mile trip. We averaged 2.4mi/kWh on our recent trip to Baton Rouge, but only 2.1mi/kWh on the trip back despite driving around the same speeds. Certainly, the wind or battery temperature could have had an impact, but I believe the major difference was that we added my niece as well as her luggage. When looking at range and 70mph tests, keep in mind they’re usually done with one driver and no luggage. If you’re road tripping with a family and a bunch of gear, you may see some significant drop-offs in efficiency. I don’t know the exact effects, but I would love to see some studies on it. 

#Bonus for Ioniq 5 shoppers: AWD and RWD get essentially the same range

You may have figured this out after number 1, but there is essentially no difference between the road trip range of a RWD and AWD I5 despite the 50 mile gap in the EPA range. My real-world experience has lined up with previous AWD tests including the InsideEvs and Out of Spec 70mph range tests. An AWD that’s driving in Eco is only using RWD, so you get almost the same range. The only difference is the slight weight difference of the front motor which is the rough equivalent of having an extra passenger. The large difference in the EPA range is due to the testing using Normal mode which utilizes AWD. So if you want an AWD, don’t worry about the range difference as long as you drive in Eco on the highway. You can still enjoy the benefits of AWD in the city. 

#Would I still buy this car if I could do it over?

Honestly, I absolute would. It’s possible that I’m still simply infatuated with the Ioniq 5 and my opinion will change in time. But as of now, I’d still much rather do an 8 hour road trip in the I5 than a 6.5 hour trip in an ICE. The quiet, comfortable, roomy ride, plus the instant torque and the ability to silently pass people before they can speed up to block you make it worth the extra time for me. I pointed out the frequent stops before, but it really helps to break up the drive so you’re not sitting in a car for hours and hours on end. Instead of one long trip, it feels more like 5 short trips. No sore butt, no back pain, no avoiding drinking so you don’t have to use the restroom. Yes, I could switch back to a gas car and just start taking breaks, but it’s a huge mental hurdle as it then feels like I’m wasting time when I could be driving. With the EV, you’re not fighting the urge to just keep pushing to get it over with. Speeding along from charger to charger is honestly fun and I have no idea when that’s going to stop being the case. Not to mention the I5 has regen paddles that let you control the regen levels, which make driving much more fun. If I’m going 100 and I see traffic ahead going 70, I can take my foot off the gas to start coasting down to the 90s. If I’m still too fast I go to Level 1 regen, still too fast and I click again to go to Level 2. It’s a constant game of how far can I go while not having to touch the gas or brake pedal. It’s honestly pretty difficult to go back to driving my Fusion after driving the I5, but the current plan is still to keep it for another 5 years…unless I stumble across a good deal for a 2017 Ioniq Electric. The point of the post isn’t to discourage anyone from getting an EV, but just to provide some additional perspective that a lot of BEVangelicals in this sub often leave out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/v4cr4m/previously_i_posted_about_needing_a_phev_for_road/

The below statement angers me because it's such shallow thinking.

""The production of EV's and their batterys cause much more pollution than ICE vehicles so they are not green tech""

Well, have you ever stopped to think just how much pollution is being caused by the drilling, extraction and refinement of oil for petrol and diesel cars? How many oceans and habitats  destroyed? How much pollution is caused by the transport of this fuel?

I have not done the maths, but my EV charging over night on renewable energy is no doubt making up for it production CO2 very quickly and is probably as close to net zero as possible.

Unfortunately, it's just a prime example of how people cannot think for themselves and join the masses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1er50hb/the_building_hate_by_the_general_public_for_ev_is/

lfbm70,"Dear GM, I don't trust your promises anymore",520,394,1612790363.0,"I was too young to remember the EV1, but I've heard lots about it.  If you don't know the history of GM's first electric vehicle it can be summed up like this: GM was forced to make zero-emissions car sales by the CARB (California Air Resources Board), they made the EV1 which turned out to be a great car, then the zero-emissions CARB mandate was gutted and GM crushed most of the EV1s despite protests from EV1 owners.

The story of the Chevy Bolt EV looks like it's turning out to be a similar story.  Chevy promised an affordable 200+ mile range EV before Tesla with the Model 3.  They delivered on that promise.  The Chevy Bolt came out slightly before the Model 3 with a 200+ mile range.  I bought a Chevy Bolt, wanting to be a part of the ""open-source"" EV community (as I refer to it) with CCS and public charging infrastructure.

After more than 2 years since buying my Bolt EV, not much from GM has changed since.  I haven't received a single over the air software update, and the car has the same annoying bugs it's had since the day I bought it.  Dealing with Chevy car dealerships is also frustrating - most employees there don't believe EVs are the future, so they know next to nothing when you want to buy one or get one serviced.  (I also had a similar experience with a Nissan Leaf in the past).  Going to a legacy car dealership with an EV feels like you're in a fringe group that they are just humoring.

So GM, you're promising to be the future of EVs... I don't buy it for a second.  You will fake support of EVs as long as you're forced too, your dealerships will fight the insurgence of EVs, you will not actively support of these vehicles once they are sold, and you will not have a good charging infrastructure for your cars.  For all of these reasons you will fail to sell EVs in impressive numbers.  And in that failure, some will say that EVs cannot be made mainstream - a point that you will make for a 3rd time in your history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/lfbm70/dear_gm_i_dont_trust_your_promises_anymore/
